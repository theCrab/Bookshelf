# Bookshelf
Hanami sample app thats is more than 'hello world!'.

This app is a sample bookshelf at your dev lab or office, you keep track of your books so you dont loose them. Or to remind you how terrible you are at reading tech books.

# Warning!
Hanami is changing fast. This app is released starting with version `0.7`. It is my hope that we can keep a realese of each new version. I also don't know if this is a good idea at all. But we'll know that in 10 years from now, lend your hand and lets give it a shot.

## Motivation
I started extracting an Authentication into a gem but could not find enough time to complete it. 2 friends joined to help but I realised we needed more than I could offer. It was easier to extract it from here than from my apps. And besides, i didnt have a good list of the features I wanted. I had started approaching authentication differently from the traditional style.

## Expectations
Like Hanami Framework. Do not expect magic. There is no Magic. The developer should have control on their code. This is only one way of doing it. **I am tired of magic**. Thanks.
